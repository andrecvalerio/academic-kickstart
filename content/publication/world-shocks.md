abstract = "Fluctuations in commodity prices have been viewed as a major driver of emerging economies business cycles. By considering a richer structure of the global economy, we show that this is not the case for Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, challenging previous findings. Aggregate shocks to the world commodity market become more relevant only when a less structured model of the international economy is in place. This is due to the fact that aggregate commodity price index reacts endogenously to other global shocks, playing a major role as a propagator, hence, this modelling choice enables capturing general equilibrium effects at world level. Our analytic framework is based on Bayesian structural VAR with block exogeneity in a sample ranging from 2000 to 2017. The global part of the VAR uses a measure of global GDP, an aggregate commodity price index, and the volatility index (VIX). The presence of this last variable, from which we study the impact of uncertainty shock in the international financial market, is responsible for modifying established results. The model also uses the following domestic variables: GDP, CPI, sovereign spread, nominal exchange rate, and policy interest rate. We conclude that global demand fluctuations are the main drivers, at international level, of domestic business cycles."
